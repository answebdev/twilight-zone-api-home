## Development

In terms of developing the application, I decided to build the app using React and CSS Modules. I decided to use pure CSS, instead of using frameworks, and to use Flexbox and media queries to create an application that would be responsive on both desktop and mobile devices. I began with the functionality of the app (e.g., fetching the data, displaying the data, nominating a movie, etc.), only adding some basic styling as needed in the beginning. As I continued to get more of the functionality working, I moved more and more to the layout and the styling. As I completed the functionality, I focused more on the styles and details of the design, including working on making it responsive across various screen sizes, which I achieved by using Flexbox, media queries, and the Responsively App.
